# Android Tinkering Projects & Notes  

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m a Software Engineering student passionate about **Android system customization**. This repo documents my experiments with:  

- **Rooting** (Magisk, custom recoveries like TWRP)  
- **GSI (Generic System Image) Flashing** (e.g., Pixel Experience, LineageOS)  
- **ADB/Fastboot Automation** (scripts for backups, debugging)  
- **System Mods** (debloating, kernel tweaks, etc.)  

## Tools & Tech Used  
- `adb`/`fastboot`  
- Magisk  
- Custom recoveries (TWRP, OrangeFox)  
- Python/Bash for automation  

## Recent Experiments  
- [ ] Successfully rooted a Redmi Note 9 using Magisk  
- [ ] Flashed a GSI ROM (e.g., Pixel Experience)  
- [ ] Wrote a Bash script to automate app backups via ADB  

*(Iâ€™ll keep updating this as I explore more!)*

## Future Plans  
- [ ] Experiment with custom kernels for performance optimization  
- [ ] Explore Magisk modules for advanced system customization  
- [ ] Automate GSI flashing using Python scripts  
- [ ] Create a guide for beginners on rooting and flashing GSIs  
- [ ] Test and document alternative custom recoveries (e.g., OrangeFox)
